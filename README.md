# prime-numbers-generator
A simple prime numbers generator

General user case and description
----------------------------------------------
As a user, I want to be able to generate prime numbers and save them (to file, database, whatever).

As a user, I want to be able to stop the generation process, and start it again from a certain point (no need to recompute previously generated numbers).
